secrets:

  # The name of an existing secret to use instead of creating one. It must
  # conform to the structure of the included secret. The advantage is that this
  # secret can be managed out of band and without any values ended up in a
  # configMap used by Tiller. If this value is set to a non-empty value the
  # other elements on secret are ignored.

  # The shared secret is the secret for the webhook in GitHub

  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious

  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
